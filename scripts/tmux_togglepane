# How do you hide a tmux pane? https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/145866

# tmux cheat sheet
#   show (show-options)
#     -w: for window (as opposed to server, session, or pane-level options)
#     -q: do not return error if option is unset
#     -v: show value only
#   lsp (list-panes)
#     -F: specify the format of each line
#   set (set-option)
#     -w: (same as show)
#     -u: unset the option
#   splitw (split-window)
#     -P: print information about the new window after it has been created
#   breakp (break-pane): break a pane out into a new window
#     -d: do not focus new window after creating it
#     -s: source pane to break
#   joinp (join-pane): insert pane into current window in a new split
#     -s: (same as breakp)
#     -l: size of new pane

# @togglepane is a user option that will store the tmux id of the togglepane
# pane. it's a window-level variable (so each window in a session can have its
# own togglepane)

# set up a tmux binding to call this script:
# bind "'" run-shell "/path/to/tmux_togglepane"
